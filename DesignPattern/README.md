# Design Problems

*Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t.*

As simple as this concept is, it forms the basis for almost every design pattern. All patterns provide a way to let some part of a system vary independently of all other parts.

## Design Principles
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
1. Favor Composition over inheritance
1. Program to an interface, not an implementation
    - Allows for flexible changes during runtime

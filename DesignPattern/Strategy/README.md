# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Key Points:
1. Allows flexible change in algorithm during runtime
1. Easily distinguishes the role/usage/requirements/functionality of each variation
1. Usually involves Interface Implementation
1. Promotes clean code, flexibility, and maintainability

When to use:
1. Algorithm needs to be changed at runtime flexibly
1. Family of related algorithms
1. Complex conditionals that can be encapsulated
